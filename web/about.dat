KV Chat Bot and this website was initially created for entertainment purposes only, 
but the facts and information purposes is still under development. 
While the bot may give some information, it shouldn't be used as a source of information. 
It can only answer simple questions and does not understand complex sentence. 
The bot understands english language only and does not use any model but uses Pre-Trained data from scratch. 
The bot was continuously being trained by the web developer himself based on userâ€™s input. 
For feedback, you can tell the chatbot directly by using <i><u>i suggest</u></i>, <u><i>i recommend</i></u>, <u><i>my feedback is</i></u>, 
etc... and the developer will see your feedback, comment, or suggestion. 
For more details on how to use the chatbot effectively, type <u>help</u>.

<u><h4>What's NEW?</h4></u>

in it's infancy and under development. The design interface has also been re-designed with but
not that much since the main theme of this website is black & white and green and cyan.
