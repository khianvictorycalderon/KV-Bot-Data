Serial ATA also known as SATA  is a data transfer interface used to connect storage devices like hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs) to a computer's motherboard. It replaced the older PATA (Parallel ATA) interface, offering faster data transfer speeds and improved efficiency. SATA cables are smaller and easier to manage, enhancing airflow inside computers. It supports features like hot-swapping, allowing drives to be added or removed while the computer is running. SATA has multiple versions, with SATA III being the most common, supporting transfer speeds up to 6 Gbps.,.
