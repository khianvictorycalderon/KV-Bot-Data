<and>help/help./help?/help,/help??=:=To use me properly, be precise and specific of what you are asking and avoid using rare or complicated words and sentences. For example you want to know multiple people, instead of asking like <u>who is kennedy and armstrong?</u>, it wonâ€™t generate the desired result because even though the first question is <u>who is kennedy</u>, the second is just mentioning armstrong and I canâ€™t interpret it as a second question. For me to better understand you, you may want to ask <u>who is kennedy? and who is armstrong?</u> That way I know that you are asking multiple questions. To make it easier for me to separate your questions, use <u>and</u> as a question separator. I also still have somewhat difficulty in a casual conversation but I may excel in math and word definition questions.<br/>
<br/>
Usage guidelines:
   <ul>
     <li>Avoid using jargon and rare words.</li>
     <li>Avoid using slang words and shortcut words.</li>
     <li>Avoid using incorrect spelling words as I am not programmed to understand incorrect word spelling.</li>
     <li>Avoid follow up questions as I don't remember previous conversations.</li>
     <li>Avoid asking conditional questions such as â€˜if i did this, then what would be the result?â€™ as I am not capable of predicting events.</li>
   </ul>
Here are few specific things i know:
  <ul>
   <li><u>Math</u>: In terms of number, i can answer basic arithmetic math questions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square roots, and cube roots, etcâ€¦ and i am capable of answering words like what is one plus one.</li>
   <li><u>Computer-Related Words</u>: I know a few common computer-related words such as database, network, algorithm, you ask me what they mean, i will give you its definition.</li>
   <li><u>Famous People</u>: I know a lot of famous people and you could also use a name descriptor like the father of computer, national hero of the philippines, etcâ€¦</li>
   <li><u>Physics, Chemistry, and Biology Why Questions</u>: I know the reason of some commonly asked science question like why is the sky blue.</li>
   <li><u>General Conversation</u>: This was my original purpose when i was initially created, initially i was programmed to understand tagalog language only, then both tagalog and english, but as my data definition set grows, my developer wants me to focus on english only to provide more accurate information. You can talk to me like a casual conversation but i may not fully understand you because the general conversation is still experimental.</li>
   <li><u>FAQs</u>: I also know some frequently related questions about me such as my name, my creator, my age, how i generate response, and something similar to that.</li>
  </ul>
While i may know a lot of things, here are my limitations:
   <ul>
    <li><u>Real-Time Update</u>: I donâ€™t have access to real-time information like time, date, news, weather, etc...</li>
    <li><u>Reference and Source</u>: While i know some things, i canâ€™t really provide where i got the information from, because i was programmed with a pre-defined data unless it is stated in it.</li>
    <li><u>Predicting</u>: I canâ€™t predict future events if you tell me something like a situational questions as i am not capable of it.</li>
    <li><u>Previous Conversation</u>: As of February 2025, I am now capable of remembering some of our previous conversation as part of version 4.0.0 remake but still in an early infancy and currently in development.</li>
    <li><u>Truth Questions</u>: Asking me whether something is true or not such as <u>is it true that you are an alien?</u> or <u>are you a stone?</u> may generate unexpected results and i may not understand it fully.</li>
   </ul>
All of these are just a few of the things I know, try asking something.
