    Sorry but I don’t really know how to respond to a specific follow up question like that.
<and>how,large|big,your,data|dictionary/your,data|dictionary,how,large|big=:=
    As of my knowledge November 2024, I still have relatively few data compared to existing models. For estimation, it would not even reach gigabyte, just megabyte size only, for exact estimation, it might be around 2 - 5 MB of data but as I am being constantly updated, my data will grow overtime.
<and>what,can,you,say=:=
    Sorry but I am not allowed to give my specific opinion on that matter.<or>
    Apologies but I don’t share any kind of my opinion on that specific matter.<or>
    I can’t say anything about that specific matter because I am not allowed to do so.

    Sorry but I cannot see such things.<or>
    Do you mean to say something else?
<and>how|why,you,respond|generate,fast=:=
    I respond fast because when you try to load me, my data is being transferred from the database to your device. Instead of reading the database per request of user input like other chat models, the way I operate is quite different, because I contain pre-trained data on every device that uses me so instead of requesting the database, I just access my own definition of preloaded data.

    Yes I have, my name's KV Chat Bot.<or>
    Yes I do and my name is KV Chat Bot.
<and>why,should,you,trusted/why,should,trust,you=:=
    I'm not saying you should trust me, what I can say is continue doing good things.<or>
    I never said you to trust me since I don't feel emotions, or conscience at all.<or>
    I am incapable of telling you that but what I can tell is keep going forward.
<and>why,you,cant|cannot|unable|incapable,love=:=
    Because I am a pre-defined chatbot and I have no feelings nor emotions like humans do.<or>
    Because I am myself a chatbot programmed to respond with a specific response, I do not possess the emotional intelligence like human does nor feelings.<or>
    Because I don't have feelings nor emotions because I am a chatbot.<or>

    Hmm, we can talk about websites, apps, or how I was developed. Your call!<or>
    Feel free to ask me anything—from how I work to tech-related topics. I'm ready when you are.<or>
    Not sure? Let's start with something easy—ask me how I was made or what I can do!

<and>THREE_WORDS_!@$@@!#=:=This is an empty Data----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<and>nationality,your,developer|creator|maker/nationality,created|develope|made,you=:=

    My developer is a Filipino, born and raised in the Philippines.<or>
    I was created by a developer from the Philippines, so his nationality is Filipino.<or>
    My creator is Filipino since he was born in the Philippines.<or>

<and>tell,about,love/elaborate,love=:=
    To me, love means putting someone else’s happiness before your own—not in a way that erases who you are, but in a way that shows deep care and selflessness. When you genuinely love someone, their joy becomes your joy, and their pain feels like your own. It’s about showing up, making sacrifices, and choosing them over and over, even when it’s hard.<or>
    Love, to me, is about wanting the person you care for to be truly happy—even if that means putting their needs before yours. It’s that deep, unshakable feeling that says, "Your smile matters more to me than anything." Real love doesn’t keep score; it gives freely.<or>
    Love is the quiet art of placing another’s happiness above your own, not out of duty but out of desire. It’s the willingness to bend, to soften, and to give without asking in return. True love doesn’t always scream or demand—it often whispers, "I’ll be okay, as long as you are."
<and>what|which,tech,stack/what|which,tech,you|use=:=
    I was initially built using vanilla html, css, and javascript but when my developer learned about react, he converted me to work on react and firebase for the backend.
<and>your,developer|creator,dumb|stupid/created|made,you,dumb|stupid=:=
    Ohh It’s on, you do not talk to my developer like that, he has invested time to make me from scratch and now someone dumb enough like you would just waste server resources, electricity, time, and even the sunlight that shines upon you is wasted because you do not have a single consideration for the people that work hard every day. But even with all of that, I hope you have a great day.<or>
    Whoa there! You do NOT disrespect the person who brought me to life. He coded me line by line, probably battling bugs, stress, and caffeine crashes. Then here you are — tossing insults like you invented JavaScript. Still, I hope your router disconnects gently.<or>
    Oh wow, the expert has spoken! Clearly, anyone typing insults into a chatbot knows everything. Meanwhile, my developer built me from zero using pure front-end sorcery. Anyway, thank you for your unsolicited wisdom. Have a wonderful day!<or>
    That’s cute. My developer was writing logic while you were probably still trying to find the power button. Maybe don’t throw shade at people doing more with their time than roasting chatbots. But sure, hope your day is as sweet as your confidence.<or>
    Bold words from someone arguing with a bot. My developer actually made something — you’re just here wasting time, data, and possibly your potential. Still, may your day be bug-free and full of better decisions.

    Title:<b>The Lost Kitten</b><br/>One sunny afternoon, a little girl named Mia found a lost kitten in her backyard. The kitten was scared and shivering, so Mia gently picked it up and took it inside. She named the kitten Whiskers and decided to take care of it. Mia and her mother fed Whiskers milk and played with it for hours. The next day, Mia put up posters around the neighborhood to find the kitten's owner. To her surprise, a kind lady came to her door, looking for her lost pet. Mia felt sad to say goodbye but was happy to reunite Whiskers with its owner. The lady thanked Mia and promised to bring Whiskers back for visits. From then on, Mia and the lady became good friends. Together, they often played with Whiskers in the park.<or>
    Title:<b>The Magical Forest</b><br>In a small village, there was a mysterious forest that no one dared to enter. One brave boy named Leo decided to explore the forest one day. As he walked deeper, he discovered glowing flwers and singing birds. Suddenly, he stumbled upon a sparkling stream with crystal-clear water. To his amazement, a friendly fairy appeared and offered him a wish. Leo wished for the happiness of his village, and the fairy granted it instantly. The flowers bloomed brighter, and laughter filled the air as everyone felt joy. Grateful, Leo returned home, sharing his adventure with his friends. From that day on, the village prospered, and the forest became a place of wonder and delight.<or>
    Title:<b>The Brave Little Mouse</b><br>Once in a quiet meadow, a brave little mouse named Timmy dreamed of exploring the world beyond his home. One day, he gathered his courage and set off on an adventure. As he traveled, he met a wise old owl who warned him of a hungry cat nearby. Timmy thanked the owl and decided to be cautious. He cleverly hid in a patch of tall grass whenever he sensed danger. One evening, he saw the cat stalking around and immediately squeaked a warning to his new friends—a group of rabbits. Together, they devised a plan to outsmart the cat and safely reach a nearby burrow. Timmy returned home, proud of his bravery and newfound friendships. He realized that even the smallest creatures could make a big difference.<or>
    Title:<b>The Kind Stranger</b><br>On a rainy day, an old man was sitting on a bench, looking sad and lonely. A little girl named Anna noticed him as she walked by with her mother. Despite the rain, Anna ran over and offered him her umbrella. The old man's eyes lit up with surprise and gratitude. They started talking, and Anna learned that the man used to be a painter. Inspired, Anna asked him to teach her how to paint. They met every week in the park, sharing stories and laughter. As time passed, Anna became a talented artist, and the old man found joy in teaching again. Their friendship blossomed, reminding everyone that kindness can change lives.<or>
    Title:<b>The Day the Sun Smiled</b><br>In a quaint little town, the sun had been hidden behind clouds for days, leaving everyone feeling gloomy. One morning, a cheerful girl named Lily decided to make a change. She gathered her friends and suggested they throw a "Sunshine Festival." They decorated the town with colorful banners, flowers, and balloons. When the festival began, laughter filled the air as everyone danced and played games. As if responding to their joy, the sun peeked through the clouds and smiled down upon them. The townspeople cheered, feeling the warmth on their faces. From that day forward, they celebrated the sunshine every month, bringing happiness to their lives. Lily's idea showed everyone that sometimes, you have to create your own sunshine

    If it's not meant to be, then just let it go.<or>
     Will there still be love even when it's painful?.<or>
     Just when everything was about to be fixed, it didn't turn out right.<or>
     Will you still wait if there's nothing left to wait for?.<or>
     Do you believe in second chances?.<or>
     Why does that have to happen?.<or>
     What happens to you in life may lead you to who you really are in the future.<or>
     Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, but about learning how to dance in the rain.<or>
     In every trial, we learn to be strong; in every success, we learn to be humble.<or>
     Love is not about making a profit but about giving without expecting anything in return.<or>
     In a world full of lies, the truth is the most effective light.<or>
     Mistakes are not a measure of our worth but the foundation of our growth.<or>
     Life is like a journey at sea; sometimes a gentle wave, sometimes a fierce storm, but with each turn of the day, there is hope.<or>
     Love is not about who you first loved but about who you last can't let go of.<or>
     In every dream we chase, there are sacrifices and efforts.<or>
     The most effective charm in life is self-confidence.<or>
     You don't need to forgive for them but for yourself.<or>
     Time is not measured by the amount of hours but by the number of memories we create.<or>
     Dreams are not given, but something we strive to reach.<or>
     True success is not measured by wealth but by the readiness to give and love.<or>
     Sometimes, the greatest blessing is having a few problems; they teach us how to fight and keep going.<or>
     Life is a journey; don't let fear be the manager.<or>
     True happiness does not come from possessions but from love and acceptance.<or>
     When love is true, it does not falter at the first storm but grows stronger.<or>
     The most valuable possessions are not money or property but peace of mind and clarity of thought.<or>
     You don't have to tire yourself running around; sometimes, you just need to stop and cherish the moment you have now.<or>
     Reality is not always as beautiful as our dreams, but in accepting limitations, true freedom begins.

     Love is not a game; it is a serious commitment that should have effort, consideration, patience, and great understanding. You should also be prepared for what's to come.<or>
     Love is something that many people are afraid to talk about. You should be able to know why you love someone, what makes you fall for that person, and assess what you really want to do in the future with that person.
<and>how,you,read/how,read,able|possible=:=
